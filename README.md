There are currently intelligent journalism, teacher and cooking tools available. In these tools, the user's text and request will be placed in a prompt and, through the API, the Gemini AI will receive the response and show it to the user as a result.
In the teach artificial intelligence section, the user enters a scientific, artistic, cultural, etc. question and this tool provides an appropriate answer.
